# Reversing an array

Arrays have a reverse method that changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, `reverseArray` and `reverseArrayInPlace`. The first, `reverseArray`, takes an array as argument and produces a *new* array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, `reverseArrayInPlace`, does what the reverse method does: it *modifies* the array given as argument by reversing its elements. Neither may use the standard `reverse` method.

Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions in the previous chapter, which variant do you expect to be useful in more situations? Which one runs faster?
